# Stock Price Prediction Based on ```LSTM Neural Network```

## 1. Abstract

In this project, the application of deep learning model -- ``long and short term memory network LSTM`` in the field of stock price prediction will be introduced, and the prediction code under the framework of Python language ```TensorFlow (Keras)``` will be learnt.





## 2. LSTM Structure

### 2.1 Definition & Advantages:

Long Short-term Memory Networks (LSTM) is a kind of *special Recurring neural network (RNN)*. Recurring neural networks have certain advantages when learning the **nonlinear** characteristics of a sequence because it is **memorability, parameter sharing and Turing completeness**. Recurring neural networks have been used in Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as speech recognition, Language modeling, machine translation and other fields, and also used in various time series prediction.

### 2.2 Structure

Through the module chain network constituted by the **LSTM cell units**, the future can be predicted through continuous learning of the input data
The following figure is the neural unit structure of the LSTM neural network. Specific and detailed introduction of LSTM structure is in the attached paper.
